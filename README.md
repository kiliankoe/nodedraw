##nodedraw

A fun little 3 a.m. project that uses paper.js to let the user draw a path of circles on the screen and share that using socket.io to other sessions connected to the same server.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kiliankoe/nodedraw.git
$ cd nodedraw
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

Open two browser windows to ```http:localhost:3000``` and drag around to see the magic happen.
